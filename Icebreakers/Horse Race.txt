Title: The Horse Race

Requirements: Facilitator, people ok with touching 
Group size: 14+
Group intimacy level: Introductary
Feeling: Energizing, goofy
Purpose: warming bodies if cold, fresh air/oxygen, waking up after lunch, breaking touch boundaries. 

Description: A fun way to get people's hearts racing and creating a sense of bonding.
Facilitator asks group to stand in a cirlce with shoulders touching. Bending over and placing hands on knees everyone is asked to clap against their thights in a rhythm similar to a galloping horse. Facilitator initiates leaning to the left and to the right and while learning the entire circle moves around in that direction. Throwing in a few jumps is fun.

Pro tips: Subtly encourage some participants to step up and take a turn. It might create chaos, but the experience of realtime leadership is fun :)
